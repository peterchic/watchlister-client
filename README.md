Watchlister

This app allows a user to search for a movie and add it to a created list. The user can name their lists and give them descriptions, then search via TheMovieDatabase API. This app is not intended to randomly search, but rather find a movie you are specifically looking for, and add it to your list. There are often many movies we come across that go into the "I need to watch that" mental space. However, when it comes time to sit down and enjoy a flick, those 'need to watch' movies are forgotten. Keeping your action, drama, romance movie lists in one place should help remove the wasted time we spend aimlessly surfing through netflix in order to find a movie you haven't seen before. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
